## Association between classes: Agregation and Composition

In the object oriented model, the association between classes represents a relationship between this classes.

We can create a class based in another classes. `but... how?`
- Using instances of base classes as fields(attributes) of the new class.

`and why?`

Because we can reuse code:

- Reusing already written classes, which had been already tested and are already working;
- Reusing code saves work for the developer and decreases the possibility of errors.


## Agregation

An object "is part of".

When the contained object makes sense even without being part of the object that contains it.

## Composition

More restrictive than the agregation.

When the contained object does NOT make sense without the object that contains it.
